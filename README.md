#### This code is inspired by a Udemy python Bootcamp i was enrolled in. This dictionary is also my own implementation with some added features.

## Required
- The dicitionary.json file is required to run this code. You can also use some other json file with the data format as :\n {"key":"value"} value is a list. 

```sh
python3 dictionary.py
```
## Features
- You can find the meaning of the word you want to search.
- This also give the meaning of the closest word if you mistype the spelling (This is not perfect but workable)

Through this code I got a better understanding of file handling and creating looped programs. Any further suggestions to improve or optimize the code are welcome.
